For the linear search function I used GeeksforGeeks for the setup.
I also used programiz as well for a reference. 
I used chatGPT to explain the enumerate, to clean the code up for me. 

For the bubble sort function I used GeeksforGeeks for the setup.
I also used programiz as well for a reference. 
I also used codeacademy as well.

The functions themselves were a little complex.
It was nice to finally dive into Big O Notation, along with recusion this week.
There were plenty of examples of code for me to use online, I needed chatGPT to help me run the test cases.
This was a fun assignment.
